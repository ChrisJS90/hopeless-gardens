    intro: "You park in the exmpty gravel parking lot and turn off the egnine. \
    You grab your backpack from the back seat and lock the doors.\
    In front of you is a tall hedge wall with a large metal gate. \
    You are in front of the soon to reopen Hope Gardens. \
    Strewn around the entrance is a bunch of trash and a bench covered in rude graffiti. \
    The gate is open, with a cut chain hanging off one side. \
    The trail of rubbish continues inside. \
    You have been called to this place help repair the damage before the grand reopening in 3 days. \
    Good luck..." ,
    run: "This place gives you the creeps. Also, you remember that you find garden gnomes creepy. \
    Even the guy who hired you looked scared of this place. Why did you take this job? Fuck this. \
    You get back in the car and drive to the nearest pub. \
    At least you didn't notice what was lurking in the bushes as the garden gate was slowly devoured by blood red vines \
    THE END.",
    enter: "You enter the park. It's a mess. Plants ripped out at the roots and tossed aside. \
    Fences broken. The map at the entrance is smashed and covered in spray paint. \
    You seriously consider tracking down the vandals and burying them up to their necks in the garden. \
    You giggle when you imagine watering them like daisies."
