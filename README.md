# Description

## The Game

Hopeless Gardens is a text based adventure game where you take a job to tidy up a park after it has been vandalised, but not all is as it seems!

As a text based adventure game, you are given prompts detailing the environment you are currently in. You type in actions, typically in a verb-noun combination, and you receive a prompt detailing what happens as a result. The actions available are move, search, pick up, use, and examine. You may also type in `help` which will bring up a list of these actions in case you forget.
